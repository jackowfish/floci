# STS

**Protocol:** Query (XML) — `POST http://localhost:4566/` with `Action=` parameter

## Supported Actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `GetCallerIdentity` | Returns the account ID, user ID, and ARN |
| `AssumeRole` | Assume an IAM role, returns temporary credentials |
| `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` | Assume a role using a web identity token (OIDC) |
| `AssumeRoleWithSAML` | Assume a role using a SAML assertion |
| `GetSessionToken` | Get temporary credentials for an IAM user |
| `GetFederationToken` | Get temporary credentials for a federated user |
| `DecodeAuthorizationMessage` | Decode an encoded authorization failure message |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_STS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |

## Trust Policy Enforcement

By default `AssumeRole` succeeds for any caller. When `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true`,
`AssumeRole` evaluates the target role's trust policy (`AssumeRolePolicyDocument`) against the caller
and returns `AccessDenied` if it is not permitted. AWS principal forms are matched — `"*"`, an
account id, an account-root ARN (`arn:aws:iam::<acct>:root`), and exact principal ARNs — and an
explicit `Deny` always wins. Both `Action` and `NotAction` elements are honored when matching
`sts:AssumeRole`. Roles that Floci has no record of stay permissive, so this only affects roles
created through IAM with a real trust policy.

The caller is the account that owns the request's credentials, whether they sign the
`Authorization` header or a presigned query string: an IAM user's or a role session's access key
belongs to its own account, not to the default one. A role session matches a `Principal` that
names its session ARN or its role's ARN, path included.

`Condition` blocks are evaluated with the same operators as identity and resource policies. The
request context holds `sts:RoleSessionName`, `sts:ExternalId` when the caller passes `ExternalId`,
`aws:PrincipalArn` (for a caller using assumed-role credentials, the role's ARN with its path, as on AWS),
`aws:PrincipalAccount`, `aws:ResourceAccount`, `aws:RequestedRegion` and
`aws:PrincipalIsAWSService`. A trust policy that requires `sts:ExternalId`, the confused-deputy
guard, refuses a call that omits it or passes another value, and a conditional `Deny` applies only
when its condition matches.

### Known limitations

- **Session tags and source identity are not modelled.** `aws:RequestTag/*`, `aws:TagKeys`,
  `sts:TransitiveTagKeys` and `sts:SourceIdentity` are not in the request context, so a condition
  on them does not match, and `sts:TagSession` and `sts:SetSourceIdentity` are not checked.
- **The caller's own permission is checked against `*`.** The caller's identity policy must allow
  `sts:AssumeRole`, but it is evaluated for resource `*` rather than the role's ARN, so a policy
  that names the role in `Resource` does not grant it.

## Web Identity Validation (IRSA)

`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` validates tokens minted by an OIDC issuer Floci hosts - currently an EKS cluster's IRSA provider.

When the token's `iss` names a known Floci issuer, all of the following are enforced:

- the RS256 signature, against the issuer's public key
- `iss` matches that issuer exactly
- `aud` contains `sts.amazonaws.com`
- `exp` / `nbf`, with 60s of clock-skew tolerance
- the role's trust policy — `Principal.Federated` plus the `Condition` block, comparing `<oidcProvider>:sub` and `<oidcProvider>:aud` with exact, **case-sensitive** equality (`StringEquals`, `StringNotEquals`, `StringLike`, and `StringNotLike` are supported)

The response carries the token's real claims in `SubjectFromWebIdentityToken`, `Provider`, and `Audience`. A bad token returns `InvalidIdentityToken` (400), an expired one returns `ExpiredTokenException` (400), and a trust policy that does not permit the subject returns `AccessDenied` (403).

By default, tokens from an issuer Floci does not host, or tokens that are not parseable JWTs, are treated as opaque and accepted for compatibility with existing workflows. When `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true`, those tokens return `InvalidIdentityToken` because Floci cannot verify a third-party provider's signature. See [EKS](eks.md) for the full IRSA walkthrough and the token-minting endpoint.

## Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Get caller identity (always works, useful for smoke testing)
aws sts get-caller-identity --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Assume a role
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/my-role \
  --role-session-name dev-session \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Get a session token
aws sts get-session-token --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

`GetCallerIdentity` is commonly used in CI pipelines and integration tests as a quick connectivity check before running more complex tests.
For temporary credentials returned by an assumed-role action, its `Arn` and `UserId` match
the `AssumedRoleUser.Arn` and `AssumedRoleUser.AssumedRoleId` returned when the session was created.

When `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_SEED_DEPLOYER_PRINCIPAL=true`, requests signed with the seeded `floci` access key return `arn:aws:iam::000000000000:user/floci-deployer`. Other unknown local credentials continue to return the account root ARN for backward compatibility.
